Themes: 
	* What if the pause button was a weapon? 
	* A game where if you touch the floor you die.
	* The only way to progress is to kill enemies and use their bodies as platforms.

Mechanics:
	* Touch floor = dead
	* Pause = you pause, the game continues
	* On enemy killed = they turn to stone
	* Enemies turned to stone = collidable
	* Single screen game
	* Each level is a screen
	* Dialog
	* Way of killing enemies = ???

Graphics:
	* If there is time. Color key maps to make things more interesting.
	* If there is time. Animate lava.

Known bugs:
	* When falling down from a block to the left. X collision doesn't kick in until you're at the ground below.
